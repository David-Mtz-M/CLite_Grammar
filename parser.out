Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . Primary
    (1) Primary -> . INTLIT
    (2) Primary -> . ( Primary )

    INTLIT          shift and go to state 2
    (               shift and go to state 3

    Primary                        shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> Primary .



state 2

    (1) Primary -> INTLIT .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (Primary -> INTLIT .)
    )               reduce using rule 1 (Primary -> INTLIT .)


state 3

    (2) Primary -> ( . Primary )
    (1) Primary -> . INTLIT
    (2) Primary -> . ( Primary )

    INTLIT          shift and go to state 2
    (               shift and go to state 3

    Primary                        shift and go to state 4

state 4

    (2) Primary -> ( Primary . )

state 5
